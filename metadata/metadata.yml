  PBCNet
  How to train the PBCNet?
  set 'code/run_training.sh' as run file

  How to finetune the PBCNet?
  set 'code/run_finetune.sh' as run file

  code/model_code
  The skeleton code of the PBCNet model.

  results_in_our_article
  Summary of the outcome data reported in the article.

  code/PBCNet.pth
  The trained PBCNet

  data
  Note: The nature of pairwise input required for PBCNet results in one sample appearing in multiple sample pairs. Therefore, to reduce the time spent on data processing during training and prediction, we store most of the data as pickle files.

  1. FEP1
  The ligands in the FEP1 set on mol2 and sdf formats; the protein and pocket files on mol2 and pdb formats; and the computing results of intermolecular interactions.

  2. FEP2
  The ligands in the FEP2 set on mol2 and sdf formats; the protein and pocket files on mol2 and pdb formats; and the computing results of intermolecular interactions.

  3. test_set_fep_graph_rmH_I
  The corresponding pickle files of the FEP1 set.

  4. test_set_fep+_graph_rmH_I
  The corresponding pickle files of the FEP2 set.

  5. finetune_input_files
  The model input files (csv files) for finetune operation.

  6. ic50_graph_rmH_new
  The corresponding pickle files of the Training set.

  7. mean_600000train_all_pair_withoutFEP.csv
  The model input files (csv files) for tarining.

  8. selection
  The ligands in the selection test set on mol2 and sdf formats and the protein and pocket files on mol2 and pdb formats.

  9. selection_graph
  The corresponding pickle files of the selection test set.
